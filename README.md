## About
### 🇮🇪👨‍💻⛵️🛶🥃🏔

You can call me Sean or Seanie. Computer Security is my thing. I previously worked for in Digg 👨‍💻, Dropbox 🔐, Patreon 🔐 and Truework 🔐 in 🚀California 🇺🇸. And some others in Ireland 🇮🇪& Canada 🇨🇦

At Patreon & Truework I was the Head of Security. Each had about 30-50 folks 👨🏽‍💻👩🏿‍💻👩‍💻 and where in hyper growth 📈. Building their security program while also securing a service under rapid 🏎 development was lots of fun. Working on everything you could imagine! Coding, product development, hiring, risk planning, cybersecurity policies & procedures, software engineering, code review, architecture and design implementation, cloud infrastructure, software development, industry standards & compliance and more!

Before all of this I was born and raised on farm 🚜 in County Tipperary 🇮🇪 Ireland. I studied computer science at NUI, Galway. Dropped out of a PhD program. Worked as white water Safety Kayaker 🛶 and Raft Guide on the Ottawa River 🇨🇦. When I went to university I took up kayaking, the following year I started coding for fun. These two events have played an important part in my life ever since. At first I just wanted to build a kayaking website, then computer security overtook kayaking as my passion. So here we are!
