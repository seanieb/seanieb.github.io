## About
### 🇮🇪👨‍💻⛵️🛶🥃🏔

Information & Cyber Security is my thing. I've worked for a bunch of companies 🚀 in San Francisco, CA; Digg 👨‍💻, Dropbox 🔐, Patreon 🔐 and Truework 🔐. And some others in Ireland 🇮🇪 and Canada 🇨🇦.

My last two roles were leading security for startups of about 30-50 folks 👨🏽‍💻👩🏿‍💻👩‍💻 in hyper growth 📈. At this stage building their security program and security hiring is critical, while also securing a service under rapid🏎 development. This is my dream role. I got to work on everything you could imagine! Coding, product development, risk planning, security policies & procedures, software engineering, code review, architecture and design implementation, cloud infrastructure, software development, standards & compliance and more!

I studied computer science at NUI, Galway. Dropped out of a PhD program. Worked as white water Safety Kayaker 🛶 and Raft Guide on the Ottawa River 🇨🇦. Born and raised on farm 🚜  in County Tipperary  🇮🇪 Ireland. I took up kayaking when I attended university, the following year I started coding. These two events have played an important part in my life ever since. At first I just wanted to build a kayaking website, then coding overtook kayaking as my passion.
