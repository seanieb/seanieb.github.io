## About
### 🇮🇪👨‍💻⛵️🛶🥃🏔

Sean, often called Seanie, originally from a farm 🚜 in County Tipperary, Ireland 🇮🇪. I started in computer science at NUI Galway. Dropped out of a PhD program. Worked as white water Safety Kayaker 🛶 and Raft Guide on the Ottawa River 🇨🇦. Kayaking and coding became my twin passions during university, shaping my life ever since.

My professional journey has taken me to Digg 👨‍💻, Dropbox 🔐, Patreon 🔐, and Truework 🔐 in California 🇺🇸, as well as companies in Ireland 🇮🇪 and Canada 🇨🇦. As Head of Security at Patreon and Truework, I took on the challenge of building security programs amidst hyper growth 📈. My work spans cybersecurity, cryptography, software & infrastucture engineering, hiring, risk planning, compliance and more. Each oft these companies had about 30-50 folks 👨🏽‍💻👩🏿‍💻👩‍💻 when I started and where in hyper growth 📈. Since then I've consulted for a number of companies both large and small.
